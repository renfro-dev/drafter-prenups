PRD: Drafter – AI-Drafted Prenuptial Agreements
1. Executive Summary
Drafter is a secure consumer web application that enables individuals and couples to generate legally sound prenuptial agreements by answering a guided intake form. The system uses a private, self-hosted large language model (LLM) fine-tuned on state-specific legal clauses and jurisdictional rules to produce a high-quality prenup draft, delivered instantly via email as a Word or PDF file.
This product democratizes access to prenuptial agreements—making them accessible, fast, and affordable—while ensuring data privacy and compliance with jurisdictional standards. The MVP focuses on California, with additional states planned as the clause library grows.

2. Business Context
Problem
Traditional prenuptial agreements are expensive and intimidating. Consumers must engage an attorney early, disclose extensive personal information, and pay $3,000–$8,000 per agreement. Many couples skip prenups due to cost or friction—leaving them exposed during divorce or estate events.
Opportunity
By pairing open-source LLM technology with a curated, jurisdiction-specific clause library, Drafter can:
Reduce drafting costs by 80–90%.


Allow users to prepare an attorney-ready draft in under 10 minutes.


Build trust via private, encrypted on-prem LLM inference—no data leaves the system.


Generate affiliate and referral revenue through attorney partnerships (paid review and filing services).


Market
~2.6M marriages per year in the U.S.; ~15% of couples now sign prenups.


Top markets: California, Florida, New York, Texas.


TAM ≈ $3.1B; early entry niche = self-help + lead-gen funnel for family-law firms.


Strategic Fit
Drafter sits within the broader Native.Legal ecosystem—AI-powered consumer legal tools that feed high-intent leads to partner law firms. Prenups are the beachhead: a clean, high-value entry point for automating other family-law documents.

3. Product Vision
Mission:
 Empower consumers to create enforceable, jurisdiction-specific prenups safely, privately, and affordably.
Core Experience:
User visits drafter.legal


Completes guided intake (names, assets, debts, timing, state, etc.).


Chooses jurisdiction (e.g., CA).


Enters email address for delivery.


Within minutes, receives a customized prenup generated from vetted clauses.


Optionally books a licensed attorney for review via partner network.


Privacy Promise:
 No user data leaves the secure environment. Drafting runs on a self-hosted Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model using RAG over a curated clause/jurisdiction corpus.

5.2 Key Components
1. Clause & Jurisdiction Library
Built using Playwright/Firecrawl scrapers.


Normalized into JSONL corpus (clauses.jsonl, rules.jsonl).


Structured with ClauseRecord@v1 and JurisdictionRule@v1 schemas.


Stored locally and indexed via Qdrant/Chroma for RAG retrieval.


2. Model Layer
Base: Llama 3.1 8B Instruct (quantized Q4_K_M).


Hosted via Ollama for simplicity (or vLLM for scaling).


Optional LoRA fine-tune on 2–5k prenup clauses for stylistic control.


3. Application Layer
Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind (simple guided form).


Backend: Supabase Edge Function or Node API for:


Intake → JSON schema validation.


Clause retrieval by jurisdiction.


LLM call and output validation.


Docx/PDF render and email send (Resend or Supabase Mail).


4. Security Layer
Local inference (no cloud API calls).


AES-encrypted user data in transit and at rest.


Optional PII masking layer (LegalGuardian-style).


Logs anonymized; deletions automatic after 7 days.


5. Template Layer
Jinja2 templates map to sections:


Definitions


Disclosure


Spousal Support


Separate/Community Property


Debts and Liabilities


Execution and Governing Law


Each clause pulled from the JSONL library based on jurisdiction logic.

Source
Description
Consumer Draft Fee
$49–$99 per prenup (document only)
Attorney Review Referral
Partner firms pay 10–20% referral fee per booked review
Subscription Tier
Firms can license the clause library + private model for internal drafting
Future Expansion
Postnups, cohabitation agreements, wills, trusts, estate planning docs


9. Metrics & Success Criteria
KPI
Target (MVP)
Conversion Rate (Landing → Draft)
≥ 15%
Draft Accuracy (Attorney Review Pass)
≥ 90%
Time to Draft

10. Future Roadmap
Phase
Focus
Phase 1 – MVP (3 months)
Build CA intake → draft → email flow. Seed clause corpus.
Phase 2 – Expansion (6 months)
Add FL, NY, TX; implement attorney dashboard; add payments.
Phase 3 – Full Platform (12 months)
Enable multi-doc types (MSAs, wills), consumer account login, analytics.
Phase 4 – AI-Ops Scaling
Continuous retraining, versioned corpus, attorney feedback loops.


11. Compliance & Risk
Disclaimers: “For informational purposes only; not legal advice. Review by an attorney recommended.”


Adhere to state bar UPL (unauthorized practice of law) limits—tool generates a draft, not a signed contract.


Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance; clear data-retention and deletion policies.
