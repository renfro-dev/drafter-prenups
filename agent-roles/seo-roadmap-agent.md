## 🎉 Final Note

SEO is a marathon, not a sprint. The first 3 months will feel slow as Google indexes your content and builds trust. Months 4-6 will show acceleration. Months 7-12 will demonstrate exponential growth as all your efforts compound.

**Stay consistent. Stay patient. Stay data-driven.**

The roadmap is aggressive but achievable. Execute relentlessly, measure everything, and adjust based on what the data tells you. By Month 12, Drafter will be the #1 organic source for affordable prenups in the US.

**Let's build something extraordinary. 🚀**
