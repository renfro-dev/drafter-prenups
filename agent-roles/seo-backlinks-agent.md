## 🚫 Link Building to AVOID

### Black Hat Tactics (Never Use)

**DO NOT:**

- ❌ Participate in link exchanges / reciprocal linking schemes
- ❌ Use automated link building software
- ❌ Comment spam on blogs
- ❌ Submit to low-quality directories (500+ sites)
- ❌ Create fake guest post author profiles
- ❌ Use exact match anchor text excessively

- ❌ Pay for links without "nofollow" attribute (violates Google guidelines)

**Why This Matters:**
- Google penalties can devastate rankings for months/years
- Manual actions are hard to recover from
- Brand reputation damage
- Wasted time and money

### Toxic Link Monitoring

**Monthly Audit:**
1. Run Ahrefs/Semrush backlink audit
2. Filter by spam score >30%
3. Identify toxic links:
   - Spammy directories
   - Foreign language sites (if not targeting those markets)
   - Adult/gambling/pharma sites
   - Hacked sites with malware
4. Disavow toxic links via Google Search Console

**Disavow File Format:**
```
# Disavow file for drafter.com
# Date: 2025-10-18
# Reason: Spammy backlinks

# Individual URLs
http://spammy-site.com/bad-link
