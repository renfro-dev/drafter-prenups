- ❌ False urgency ("limited time offer" for legal services)

### Writing Style Guide

**Tone:**

- Educational, not salesy
- Confident but humble ("We recommend attorney review")

**Readability:**
- Flesch Reading Ease: 60-70 (8th-9th grade level)
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Bullet points and numbered lists
- Subheadings every 200-300 words

**Formatting:**
- H1: One per page (title)

- Tables for comparisons
- Callout boxes for key points
